      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Elevator Pitch
        My idea is to have a dirt bike/motorcycle rental website. The website’s purpose is to attract potential customers to my website and get them interested/give them information 	about dirt bikes. My unique selling proposition is to make a site that gives all the information about the bikes, including price, and offers easy access to the actual rental portion of the site so you don’t have to search for it like you do for other sites. Think about the last time you tried to find dirt bike rentals online. Did you find any good site? Were they easy to access and did they have all the information that you were searching for? I promise to make an easy to use rental site that gives you all the information you desire, especially price and availability.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended auidence broadly speaking is those that are seeking for motorcycle/dirtbike rentals. More specifically they will mostly be between the ages of 16-50 year olds. My site will be geared towards both beginner riders and experienced ones, but will learn towards less experienced riders. However, my page will have plenty of info to satisfy both groups as I want everyone to be able to find the information that they are looking for.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Why people will visit site:
          People who will come to visit my site will be people who are interested in either learning more about dirt bike/motorcycle rentals or just want more info about bikes in general. They will want to know how much rentals cost, the specs of the bikes, and where we are located. 

        Why pick this site:
          Visitors will come to my site and pick it over others to get this information and complete the actions because: My site will be much easier to use and will be a lot user friendly, it will offer easy to view information on the price and specs of the bikes, I have noticed when looking at other sites that it can be sometimes difficult to find out how much it actually costs to get a rental, and I want this information to be top priority so the customer can immediately see if this is what they want, some other sites don’t even list how much their rentals cost and rely upon people to visit their physical store in order to see prices and actually pay for rentals, I want to make it so that they can complete the entire process of picking out the proper bike, choosing their preferred date of rental and actually paying for the rental completely online, so the only reason they need to come to the physical store is to pick up the bike

        Activities to complete on site:
          Some activities that visitors will want to complete on my site will be: They will want to see the prices listed for the bike rentals and safety gear, and they will also want to be able to place reservations on bike rentals, so they are not required to come to the brick-and-mortar shop to do so
